## **Introduction**
Cholera is an acute diarrheal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. It remains a global threat to public health and a key indicator of inequity and social development. According to WHO, cholera spread globally during the 19th century from its original reservoir in the Ganges delta in India, leading to six pandemics that killed millions. The current (seventh) pandemic began in South Asia in 1961, reaching Africa in 1971 and the Americas in 1991, making cholera endemic in many countries.

The data illustrates the incidence of cholera cases documented over sixty-seven years. The year 1949 marked the lowest number of cases, while significant peaks were observed in 1991 and 2011. The surge in 1991 is attributed to a new strain that spread beyond its typical range  [GD1](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00036609.htm). Increased outbreaks may also result from antibiotic resistance in variants of the causative organisms [GD2](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.12.003).

The primary dataset includes the top ten countries affected by cholera, primarily developing nations. India ranks first due to its significant reliance on untreated drinking water in rural areas. Each of these nations faces substantial economic challenges  [GD3](https://doi.org/10.1128/cmr.15.4.757-770.2002).

Factors such as the absence of healthcare services, limited access to safe drinking water, climate change impacts, and ongoing conflicts significantly contribute to cholera-related fatalities. The unavailability of antibiotics in impoverished regions further exacerbates the situation. Analysis reveals that the majority of countries with the highest increase in cholera deaths are developing nations, where vulnerable populations lack access to clean water and sanitation [GD4](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera).

Interestingly, a European nation reported unexpectedly high mortality rates, possibly indicating treatment resistance or a population primarily composed of the elderly and young children  [GD5](https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciae236). While the number of cholera cases has risen, both the death rate and fatality rate have declined, primarily due to improvements in healthcare access and sanitation.

## **Conclusion**
Cholera remains a persistent public health challenge, particularly in developing nations. Addressing the root causes, such as access to clean water and healthcare, is crucial in mitigating the impact of this preventable disease.
